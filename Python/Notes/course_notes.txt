Python course notes

# Notes

/ {normal division operator, will return a float value if needed}

// {rounds to floor the result of a division operation}

round() {rounds to ceiling the division operation or a given float point value within}

% {will return the remainder of a given division operation}

** {powers operation}

+= , -= , *= , /= {will operate on the value stored on the variable given}

== , != , >=, <= {comparison operators}

not {p -> !q}

and {p -> q ^ r}

or {p -> q v r}

// Tuples:

They're like lists, but they do not allow change to the data that is already present in the tuple, and their order will not change as well. 


// Lambdas

Also known as anonymous functions, so far I understand them as a way to write inline functions.

// File operations

r - .read() - will return the contents of the file.
a - .access() - creates a file if one doesn't exit, if it does it will append any new contents to it.
w - .write() -
x - .create() -
