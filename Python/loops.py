# Lesson 8 - Loops

# While loops

# var = 0
# while var <= 10:
#     print("var is equal to {}".format(var))
#     var+=1

# For loops

# names = ["Dave","Sarah","John"]
# count = 0
# for name in names:
#     print("User number {}, name: {}".format(str(count + 1), name))
#     count+=1

# for x in "OHIO":
#     print(x)

for n in range(4):
    print(n)
