TO COMPILE A C PROGRAM INTO A .EXE THAT CAN BE RUN INSIDE ON WINDOWS, FIRST INSTALL THE CROSS COMPILATION TOOLCHAIN:

$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt install mingw-w64

THEN IN ORDER TO COMPILE STATICALLY (SO THAT THE PROGRAM CAN BE RUN ON ANY WINDOWS ENVIRONMENT), RUN THE FOLLOWING COMMAND:

$ x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc your_program.c -o your_program.exe -static-libgcc
