Study folder for my C++ projects

Notes:

1) For cmake:

   Create a new directory, put the following lines inside a 'CMakeList.txt' 
   	
	cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.10)
	project(APP_NAME)
	add_executable(APP_NAME main.cpp)

   Then input on the command line: cmake -S src -B build,
   following this 'cd' into 'build' and input: make,

   To conclude, run your new binary: $ ./APP_NAME
   
2) The numbered directories have some resources for building other projects
