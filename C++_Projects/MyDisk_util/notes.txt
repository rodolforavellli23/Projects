Notes for building the executable:
==================================

1) This executable requires the -std=c++20 flag to work, as it uses features introduced in that release of the C++ standard.

2) The header "getmemsize.hpp" depends on the "gettype.hpp" header to be on the same work directory.

3) The header "colortxt.hpp" contains the text color functions and a comment with the most common color codes.
