### ChatGPT explaing how the main function args work ###

Good evening! Let's break down the arguments of the `main` function in C++:

### `int main(int nNumberofArgs, char* pszArgs[])`

1. **`int nNumberofArgs`**:
   - This argument represents the number of command-line arguments passed to the program.
   - `nNumberofArgs` includes the program's name itself, so it's always at least 1.
   - For example, if you run the program as `./program arg1 arg2`, `nNumberofArgs` will be 3 (one for the program's name and two for the arguments).

2. **`char* pszArgs[]`**:
   - This is an array of C-style strings (null-terminated character arrays), where each element is one of the command-line arguments.
   - `pszArgs[0]` is the program's name (or the path to the executable), and `pszArgs[1]`, `pszArgs[2]`, etc., are the additional command-line arguments.
   - `char*` means that each element in the array is a pointer to a `char` (character), so `pszArgs[]` is an array of pointers.

### Example
If you run a program with the following command:

```bash
./myProgram firstArg secondArg
```

Then:
- `nNumberofArgs` will be `3`.
- `pszArgs[0]` will be `"./myProgram"`.
- `pszArgs[1]` will be `"firstArg"`.
- `pszArgs[2]` will be `"secondArg"`.

This allows you to process and work with the command-line arguments within your program.
